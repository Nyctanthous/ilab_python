A collection of the Python scripts I've written for PHY240: Intermediate Laboratory.

_E-M_ corresponds to the data analysis for J. J. Thompson's e/m experiment determining the charge-to-mass ratio of an electron.

_Millikan_ corresponds to the Millikan Oil Drop experiment, where we used machine vision to analyze significant amounts of experimental data to come up with a value for the charge of an electron.
